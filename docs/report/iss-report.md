# 1 Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive narrative description of the proposed cryptographic simulation for the healthcare provider, St. John's Clinic. The design has been implemented in such a way that it addresses the key security gaps within the clinic's data protection requirements, in order to align with compliance standards, and provide robust safeguarding mechanisms to secure sensitive data, that is, patient personal information, medical prescriptions, financial transactions, research data, and so on.

A current analysis of the cybersecurity practices which St. John's Clinic need to implement for security enhancement falls into the following areas of:

- Authentication
- Key management (and its relevant key lifecycle stages)
- Role based access control
- Cryptographic encryption algorithms
- Secure data transmission

# 2 Proposed simulation

For reference, please see [Appendix 5.1](#51-sequence-diagram) for the sequence diagram.
